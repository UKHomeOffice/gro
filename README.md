## GRO Business Logic

### Online Orders
The order number given online from the GRO website is always in the format COLXXXXXX/YYYY. This regex has been set to follow this format for the 'online-toggle-text' field, i.e. /^COL[0-9]{6}\/[0-9]{4}$/

### Telephone Orders
Telephone orders, the order number is also incremental so will eventually go from 5 to 6 digits, it is followed by a hyphen and line number to indicate which row dependant on the number of items ordered â€“ most orders this is just a single digit but can be up to 3 digits for big orders with 100+ order lines.
The order number has been set on field 'telephone-toggle-text' using a regex validation to capture this, i.e. /^[0-9]{5,6}-[0-9]{1,3}$/

The customer has an account number (1-7 digits long but this is incremental so will eventually get to 8 digits).
The account number has been set on field 'telephone-toggle-text-2' using validations to ensure only a number between 1-8 digits long can be entered to capture this.
